## v0.13.0 - 2025-09-11
### Added
- Expert option to disable certificate validation of the Home Assistant WebSocket server connection  ([#71](https://github.com/unfoldedcircle/integration-home-assistant/pull/71)).

### Fixed
- Initial setup with a wss:// Home Assistant URL or switching from ws to wss doesn't require a reboot anymore ([#73](https://github.com/unfoldedcircle/integration-home-assistant/pull/73)).
- Report the correct integration version without the "-dirty" suffix if it was built with a clean codebase.

- The mapping of binary sensors has changed to better represent them on the user interface ([#74](https://github.com/unfoldedcircle/integration-home-assistant/pull/74)):
    - The device class is now set to `binary` instead of `custom`.
    - The Home Assistant device class is stored in the `unit` attribute.
    - The `value` attribute is no longer a boolean, but contains the `on` and `off` sensor text values from Home Assistant.

### Changed
- Rustls upgrade to 0.23 with system certificate verifier ([#73](https://github.com/unfoldedcircle/integration-home-assistant/pull/73)).
